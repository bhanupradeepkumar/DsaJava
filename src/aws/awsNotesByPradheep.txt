9 days --> aws training will be
Pradheep John R //aws instructor  
start with the basics

what do u mean by cloud computing 

normal data centre and cloud computer difference 
the infrastructure that we setup is our own i require various teams to maintain and moniter that infrastrcuture 
if 100 users were coming and 10 users are coming in it isn not good 

cloud the infrastructure part we dont have to worry about 
that is taken care by organization which gives 
we just utilize that resources and pay for that only 


to manage the load we use the concept ha high availability 

can acccess bank 24 hrs and maintaince window will be there 

tooo many people access then resource contention might happpen 


access live stream video streaming then cloud computing comes to picture where it deliver the data quickly 


on premisis //organisation data center
cloud //capablity of access to data 


service models 
iaas - infrastructure as a servicer

i control that i need to take care of guest os runtime and virtualisation 
paas - platform as a service
application and data part i need to take care 
saas - software as a service 
everything will be provided by cloud provider 

scaling means as and when resources were required u need to provide or capability of providing that resources 
may be more demand in resources or less demand in resources 
scale up(higher ampount) or scale down (lesser amount )

scaling is done automaticaly by environment is auto scaling 
software as a service example:-netflix we dont know from where they are hosting the data 



in organization 
working on application the data is stored in database 
maintain the database if newer version it is paas worry about platform and data 


client say i have requirement i want my data in big data environment 
that too i want to run the data in multi clusters environment 

Aws >Azure> Gcp OracleCloud ibmWatson
we cant say which is best 
which cloud company is has high market share 
user friendlyness is azure 

with robust and fast aws is best which 200+ services 

how to work with aws console 

account security credentials 
gorrek_Genesis
Aasr


login as a root user use multi factor authentication 

1061 2973 2153 account id

we deploy our resources in region 
mumbai hyderabad(2022)

services>database>rds(traditional)
		>dynamo db 
services > traditional>Ec2

if we click on aws logo it goes to recently visisted home page 

left of account there is region 

check which area servers were there in which area 
where customer is there 

availability zone is an environment that is identified within a aregion and in which region 
which is not present in same fault line 


availability zones are not same fault zones if u deploy one application will be made in available zones 
so can use 24/7 
segregated as fault lines and highly available 

Mumbai 
avail zones 3
local zone s 2


local zone is extension of region 
delhi 
kolkata 

*region
*availability zone 
*local zone
*fault zone  

region 
Local Zones are designed to bring the core services needed for the latency sensitive portions
of your workload closer to end-users, while Availability Zones provide access to the full array 
of AWS services.


These locations are categorized by regions and Availability Zones.
AWS Regions are large and widely dispersed into separate geographic locations. 
Availability Zones are distinct locationswithin an AWS Region.
that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.


change location 
s3 most common used 
simple storage services 
buckets are containers for data stored in s3.

ap-south-1 which is region identifier 

where does the security come from 
iam -identity access management 
acl -access control list 

go to 3 
give name and select region 
objcet owner ship 
and acl enabled 
and public should acces or not 



click on create bucket 

go to object 

and later select properties  arn amazon resource name  and check resourse is in in which region 
later management 

using this resource name i can access bucket 
ui is going to come from this arn 
copy arn and go to web browser and access to 

https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
in objects upoad image 

click on name of that image 
then uri will be there 
uniform resource identifier 
object url is link 

click on permissions change permisiions 
acl enabled save changes 
go to buckets permissions go to access 
public access list and read 
on that specific object like image permissions and bucket also i need to giv eprivilages 

if we remove permissions then user cant access 






wherever u r sitting the request will be made available in aws region 
unless or until made available in multiple region 

if u want u can make ur resource available in multiple region 
u need consider 



https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/


programming languages can be used 

click on command line tools and then download  aws command line 
download 64 bit aws command line interface 

but we installed but we need to configure to acccess my cloud 


that comes from security credentials 

we require access key 
create access key u can activate or deactivate accordingly 
without access u cant use cli 
and configure region where iam accessing the 
what configuration is already done 

***configure cli 
aws configure list //command to get list 

now start configuring 
aws configure set region ap-south-1 //
now in windows explorer u can new file config is create which has region in it 
aws 
use secret key 
bring credentials file into .aws folder 

now when u use aws configure list 

or it will ask each if we use this command 
aws configure 
it will ask each and everyone 
access id 
secret key
default region ap-south-1
default output format json 


to set profile
set AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=default 
 

listing files in s3 
aws s3 ls 

we can create objects from cli 
very simple make sure that we point to correct region and 
we point to correct authenticattion mechanism 


now start creating a bucket 
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket demobucket-gorre-cli//error region specific 

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket demobucket-gorre-cli --region ap-south-1
//cant access s3 api error 

make bucket 
specify region 
aws s3 mb s3://demobucket-gorre-cli --region ap-south-1

aws s3 ls 
now new bucket is created 


we can also use  remove that using 
no need to give location 
if data is present use --recursive 
rm->remove objects 
rb->remove bucket itself
aws s3 rm s3://demobucket-gorre-cli --recursive


go to object happyface.jpg actions copy object and place that in bucket 

aws s3 rb s3://demobucket-gorre-cli

another service 
vpc --virtual private cloud 

pickup information of vpcs 
aws ec2 describe-vpcs

comfortable with management console and command line environment 
sop cant give access to management most of times 


to get all commands 
[12:29 PM] Pradheep John (Presenter) (Guest)
08/28
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

aws --version
always check the documentation for commands 



if we close command prompt the profile is not setting up 

to resolve this environment variables comes to the picture 

setx AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=default 

close and open its set ....machine level its updated ...
***
setx is command to set permanently 

now check aws configure list 

	
it wll permanent till u change it 


use correct options in command 

aws s3 ls //list down particular commands 

aws s3 rm s3://demobucket-gorre --recursive //empty all objects in that particular bucket 

aws s3 rb s3://demobucket-gorre //remove my entire bucket


in our case they created users but they have not given permissions 



iam>users>gorre>create access key cli then next 
then download csv file 


if u want to access this user in cli then in credentials file 

write 
----------
[gorre]
aws_access_key_id = ********
aws_secret_access_key = *******
-----------
replace * with values from csv 

now in cli
aws configure set profile gorre
aws configure list 
but default profile is set 

another way  is 

set AWS_PROFILE=gorre
aws configure list now its changed 



also in config file set location 
write 
-------


-------


set AWS_PROFILE=gorre 


works fine 


aws configure set region ap-south-1
aws cofigure list 
//
[profile gorre]
region=ap-south-1
output = json

set AWS_PROFILE= gorre
aws  configure list 

entire info will displayed 

next aspect BASICS 


--------
how to create our own virtual private cloud 


logical entity //virtual
u specify what can be access 
vpc --logically isolated virtual network 
with in the vpc a range of ip adresssess are called subnet 


in region multiple available zone 
vpc can scan over multiple availability zones as part of that particular vpc 
*****(**)***
each subnet must reside with only one availability zone 


i have one 1 vpc i have 3 availabilty zones with 6 subnet 
categorize as private or public
no connectivity from internet environment 
public subnet means yes u can connect from internet and all 

-------
internet gate way is entry point to the network(Vpc)
any request need to pass through as a door man


https://cidr.xyz
classless inter domain rooting 
cidr stands for range of  ip adressses

2 types of ip adressess
ipv4 -32 bit enity
`	10 . 88 .135 .144 /28
10.0.0.0
each part is octet 32/4 
can specify how many range of network u can have and how many host we can have 

we also different classes of ip adress that are there 
class a - 0 -127 
class  b -128-191
class c -192-223
class d -224-239
class e - 240-255
certain address are reserved adresses for example all zeroes is reserved 
adresss like 0.0.0.0/0   -->open ip

127.0.0.8/0 ->loop back adresss most common used ip adresss 
0.0.0.8/0 ->any host within network 


------normal 
10.0.0.40/? ->16 
we call ? it has mask  2^16 =65536 adreesss
the first two octet is used to identify network 
the 3 and 4 octect specify the physical machine 


10.0.0.40/24
count -256- zeroes = 255 

172.31.0.0/16
this means that 16 bits will be used identify network 
with in 16 i can use 65,536 ip adresss of machine 
subnet is part of ip adresss 
always subnet will be higher than u specified 
the ranges should not overlapping 
verfy careful when specify ip adresss cidr ranges 

work with internet gate way which is specified what will be allowed or what not 

different route table will be creeated here 2 were created 
1 for public and 1 for private 

next level of abstraction comes to picture 

route table we specify set of rules which is called as roots 
which determines where traffic is going it.

private will communicate with local gate way 
public will communicate with internet gate way 

if i dont specify no body cant access anything 
--------------------
ipv6 -128 bit enity
